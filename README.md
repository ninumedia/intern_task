Nimia Intern Take Home
======================

Create an app in Django or NodeJS. The app must do the following:

1. Accepts a link to a Youtube Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIbD7fVIRF8)
2. Sends user to a page that displays an embedded version of that youtube player
	Optional: Store each youtube link submission and create a list view that lets you navigate to those videos
3. Push the app code to a public Github repository

Take as long as you need. Try to document what was easy or difficult and any thoughts on design decisions you made while writing the app.
